# tests/test_step11_weather_timing.py
"""Regression guard for the greeting-step "narrate then stall" timing bug.

A production call log showed Buddy answer a weather request in the greeting
step by speaking a yielding "let me check the weather, please hold" line and
then waiting. The next_step transition to the weather step and the get_weather
call only fired on the caller's NEXT utterance, leaving ~14 seconds of dead air.

The fix keeps tools scoped per step (so step_change events still power the
State Flow tree) but (a) supplies next_step internal fillers so the platform
speaks DURING the transition instead of leaving the model to narrate a yield,
and (b) instructs the greeting step to move to the chosen topic immediately
without announcing a check, fetch, or hold. The destination step owns the
"checking" audio via the get_weather SWAIG fillers, which play during execution.
